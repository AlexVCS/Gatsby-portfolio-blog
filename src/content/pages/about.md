Hi! My name is Alex and I'm a developer. I'm focused on Front-End Development. I began my coding journey by taking and completing a [TechDegree](https://teamtreehouse.com/techdegree/front-end-web-development) from Treehouse. That helped me get my foundation in HTML, CSS, SCSS and JavaScript.

Now I'm working on personal projects and more courses to build my development toolbox. I'm enrolled in the Full Stack Open 2020 course from University of Helsinki along with other members of the [Code Book Club](https://madisonkanna.com/codebookclub/). We help each other and are becoming savvy full stack devs together.

In my free time I like to be around friends and family, play basketball and learn French! Merci ðŸ˜€
