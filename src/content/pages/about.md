My name is Alex and I love to code! I'm focused on Front-End Development. I began my coding journey by taking and completing a [TechDegree](https://teamtreehouse.com/techdegree/front-end-web-development) from Treehouse. That helped me get my foundation in HTML, CSS, SCSS and JavaScript. Now I'm working on personal projects and more courses to build my development toolbox.

In my free time I like to spend time with friends and family, stay active and am a life long learner!
